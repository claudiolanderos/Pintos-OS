# Pintos-OS

Pintos is computer software, a simple instructional operating system framework for the 80x86 processor architecture. 
It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way.

Edit: Had to manually import files from local file system so commits are simply the imports.
